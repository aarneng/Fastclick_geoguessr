# Geoguessr "show more" spammer

Ever been annoyed at how geoguessr leaderboards will only let you load 25 players at a time? Me too! So here's a bot that'll spam that button for you.

Chrome/chromium: Download the files, go to your browser's extention page, enable developer mode, then press "load unpacked". Chuck the downloaded files here :)
